Hello world,
I am Ava a student currently studying at BHASVIC, with the aim to pursue a career in pharmacy. I currently study: further maths, computer science and chemistry. Upon finishing college, I am going to pursue a degree in chemistry. \
 Currently, I am working on my A-level coursework, which is developing an app which allows you to make a diagram for a chemistry practical and then generates a risk assessment accordingly. \
 Previsouly, I have been devolping my coding abilities by taking part in group projects (including one which imitates a system for a hotel) and studying the course I am doing. At my secondary, I took th computer science GCSE, and I thourhly enjoyed it, resulting in me choosing to take the subject at A-level.
